  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">About</h1>

  <p class="text-lg opacity-90">
    I’m a backend developer and machine-learning practitioner focused on <strong>recommender systems</strong> and data-intensive backends.
    I combine an engineering mindset with a business background (HEC Montréal, bilingual program) to build systems that are technically sound
    and aligned with product goals. I value clarity, measurable outcomes, and reliability in production.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">What I build</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 opacity-90">
    <li><strong>Hybrid recommenders:</strong> ALS for warm users, attention-pooled subject embeddings for cold start, LightGBM reranking to blend signals and metadata.</li>
    <li><strong>Production APIs:</strong> FastAPI services with clean contracts, caching, pagination, and observability; deployed behind Nginx.</li>
    <li><strong>Data & MLOps:</strong> SQL schemas, feature pipelines, scheduled retraining, artifact versioning, CI/CD, and hot reloads without downtime.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">Selected project</h2>
  <p class="opacity-90">
    <strong>Book Recommender (production):</strong> end-to-end system with normalized SQL schema, ALS candidate retrieval, subject embeddings with attention pooling,
    LightGBM reranker, and a FastAPI service that serves real-time recommendations. The pipeline retrains daily and hot-reloads artifacts, balancing accuracy and latency.

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">Before programming</h2>
  <p class="opacity-90 mb-4">
    From age seven to sixteen I practiced karate, eventually earning a black belt at fifteen. It was the first skill I truly mastered, and it taught me discipline
    and perseverance—showing up, training hard, and pushing through setbacks. A few months after reaching black belt, I managed to break a cement block with my bare hands,
    something I would have thought impossible when I started. Karate proved that limits could be surpassed with time and dedication, and it gave me a framework for how to
    bring any skill to an advanced level.
  </p>
  <p class="opacity-90 mb-4">
    Around the same period, I ran a small student lawn-mowing company from ages 15 to 18. I found clients, managed schedules, and even employed friends. It was my first
    attempt at building something entirely on my own, with no one above me to rely on. More importantly, it forced me to take myself seriously at a young age—not just as
    a kid doing odd jobs, but as someone accountable to paying clients and responsible for outcomes. That experience taught me independence, early leadership, and what it
    means to be fully responsible for a project from start to finish.
  </p>
  <p class="opacity-90 mb-4">
    A bit later, I dove into music production. Unlike karate, where I had teachers, or lawn care, where the service was clear, music was something I had to figure out entirely
    on my own. I had never played an instrument, but I started from scratch on my computer, learning how to compose, produce, and eventually release music online. It was the
    first time I taught myself a completely new skill without guidance, and it gave me a lasting meta-skill: learning how to learn. I built confidence that even in fields where
    I had no background, I could teach myself from zero through curiosity, persistence, and iteration. Although I eventually shifted my focus to programming and machine learning,
    I still enjoy creating music from time to time.
