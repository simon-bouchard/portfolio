### Overview
This was the **first coding project I ever made that wasn’t just an exercise**.  
I wanted to practice what I learned from **w3schools tutorials (HTML/CSS/JS/PHP)** while also reinforcing ideas from **MIT’s Missing Semester**. The result was a simple static-ish site that collected my solutions and exercises in one place.

### Why it mattered
- It was **basic and only frontend**, but it taught me how to connect pieces together and finish something.  
- It was deployed on its **own cloud VM** that I configured myself (DNS, SSL, Nginx).  
- That made it the **first “product” I ever delivered**, and it set the tone: I enjoy shipping **end-to-end systems**, not just code snippets.

### Looking back
The site isn’t pretty or sophisticated, but it represents an important milestone:
- I learned how to move from tutorials → building a real project.  
- I got my first taste of **server setup, deployment, and shipping live code**.  
- It still reminds me of how far I’ve come since those early days.
